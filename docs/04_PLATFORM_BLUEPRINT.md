## 1. What is a Tenant?

A **tenant** is an individual school registered on the CloudCampus platform. Each tenant:

- Has a **unique schema** in the PostgreSQL database (complete data isolation)
- Has a **unique `tenantId`** (business identifier, e.g., `greenwood`)
- Has a **schema name** (used as the `X-Tenant-ID` header in API requests)
- Has customizable **branding** (school name, logo, primary color)
- Is completely isolated — no data is shared between tenants

All API requests targeting a specific school must include the `X-Tenant-ID` header set to that school's schema name.

## 2. Tenant Onboarding Flow

### Step-by-Step: Creating a New School Tenant

**Prerequisite:** You must be authenticated as `SUPER_ADMIN`.

```
Step 1: Log in as Super Admin
────────────────────────────────
POST /api/v1/auth/login
Body: { "username": "superadmin", "password": "<bootstrap_password>" }
→ Receive JWT token

Step 2: Create the tenant
────────────────────────────────
POST /api/v1/tenants
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body:
{
  "tenantId":    "greenwood",
  "schoolName":  "Greenwood High School",
  "schemaName":  "greenwood",
  "logoUrl":     "https://example.com/logo.png",
  "primaryColor": "#10b981"
}
→ Schema "greenwood" created
→ All 13 domain tables provisioned automatically

Step 3: Create the School Admin user
────────────────────────────────
POST /api/v1/users
Authorization: Bearer <token>
X-Tenant-ID: greenwood
Body:
{
  "fullName": "Sarah Admin",
  "username": "sarah.admin",
  "email":    "sarah@greenwood.edu",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "role":     "SCHOOL_ADMIN"
}

Step 4: School Admin logs in
────────────────────────────────
POST /api/v1/auth/login
X-Tenant-ID: greenwood
Body: { "username": "sarah.admin", "password": "SecurePass123!" }
→ School is ready for use
```

### What Gets Created Automatically

When a new tenant is provisioned, the following are created in the new schema:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | Staff accounts |
| `students` | Student records |
| `teachers` | Teacher records |
| `classes` | Class levels |
| `subjects` | Academic subjects |
| `sections` | Class sections |
| `attendance_records` | Daily attendance |
| `fee_assignments` | Fee assignments |
| `fee_payments` | Payment records |
| `exams` | Scheduled exams |
| `exam_results` | Student results |
| `homework_assignments` | Homework tasks |
| `timetable_slots` | Weekly schedule |
| `parent_students` | Parent-child links |

---

## 9. Fee Payment Flow

The fee system tracks assignments and payments with automatic status transitions.

### 9.1 Fee Assignment Statuses

```
PENDING           No payments recorded yet
    │
    ├─ Partial payment ──→ PARTIALLY_PAID    Some balance remains
    │
    └─ Full payment ─────→ PAID              Fully settled
    
PENDING / PARTIALLY_PAID → OVERDUE           (after due date, not yet fully paid)
```

### 9.2 End-to-End Fee Flow

```
1. Admin assigns fee:
   POST /fees/assignments
   { studentId, feeTitle: "Term 1 Tuition", amount: 15000, dueDate: "2026-05-31" }
   → status: PENDING

2. Student/Parent views fee:
   GET /fees/students/{studentId}/assignments
   → sees amount, dueDate, status: PENDING

3. Admin records payment (partial):
   POST /fees/payments
   { feeAssignmentId, amountPaid: 8000, paymentMethod: "CASH", referenceNo: "RCP-001" }
   → fee status auto-transitions to: PARTIALLY_PAID

4. Admin records remaining payment:
   POST /fees/payments
   { feeAssignmentId, amountPaid: 7000, referenceNo: "RCP-002" }
   → fee status auto-transitions to: PAID

5. Overpayment attempt:
   POST /fees/payments { amountPaid: 500 }
   → ERROR: "No balance to receive"
```

### 9.3 Business Rules

- Payment amount cannot exceed remaining balance
- All amounts stored as `DECIMAL` for precision (no floating point)
- Payment method field accepts any string (e.g., `CASH`, `BANK_TRANSFER`, `CHEQUE`)
- Reference number is optional but recommended for audit trail

---

## 10. Timetable System

The timetable stores weekly recurring class schedules per class/section.

### 10.1 Structure

Each timetable slot represents one period in the weekly schedule:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `classId` | Which class this slot belongs to |
| `sectionId` | Optional: which section |
| `subjectId` | Optional: which subject is taught |
| `dayOfWeek` | 1 = Monday … 7 = Sunday |
| `startTime` | Period start (HH:mm) |
| `endTime` | Period end (HH:mm) |
| `label` | Description (e.g., "Mathematics - Period 1") |

### 10.2 Creating a Full Weekly Schedule

```
POST /api/v1/timetable/slots  (repeat per period)

Monday Period 1:
{ classId, sectionId, subjectId, dayOfWeek: 1, startTime: "08:00", endTime: "09:00", label: "Maths" }

Monday Period 2:
{ classId, sectionId, subjectId, dayOfWeek: 1, startTime: "09:00", endTime: "10:00", label: "English" }

Tuesday Period 1:
{ classId, sectionId, subjectId, dayOfWeek: 2, startTime: "08:00", endTime: "09:00", label: "Science" }
...
```

### 10.3 Viewing the Timetable

```
GET /api/v1/timetable/classes/{classId}/sections/{sectionId}
→ Returns all slots for that class/section, sorted by dayOfWeek and startTime
```

Accessible by: all authenticated users (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent).

---

## 11. Bulk Upload System

The bulk upload feature allows School Admins to import large datasets via Excel.

### 11.1 Supported Data Types

The Excel workbook can contain these sheets:

| Sheet Name | Data |
|------------|------|
| `Students` | Admission no, name, DOB, gender, email, phone |
| `Teachers` | Employee no, name, email, phone, hire date |
| `Classes` | Class name, code |
| `Sections` | Section name, class code |

### 11.2 Upload Steps

```
Step 1: Download the sample template
GET /api/v1/bulk/sample
→ Save the .xlsx file

Step 2: Fill in the template with your data
(follow column headers exactly)

Step 3: Upload the filled file
POST /api/v1/bulk/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file: <your_filled_template.xlsx>

Step 4: Review the response
{
  "successCount": 48,
  "failedCount": 2,
  "errors": [
    { "sheet": "Students", "row": 5, "error": "Duplicate admission number" }
  ]
}
```

### 11.3 Error Handling

- Rows with errors are **skipped**, not rolled back entirely
- Valid rows in the same upload are still processed
- Errors include sheet name, row number, and reason
- Re-upload only the failed rows after fixing them

---

## 12. Subscription & Billing System

### 12.1 Plans

CloudCampus offers four pre-seeded SaaS plans. Plans are stored in the `public` schema and accessible to all tenants.

| Plan | Price | Billing Cycle | Max Students | Max Teachers |
|------|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| FREE | ₹0 | 30 days | 50 | 5 |
| BASIC | ₹2,999 | 30 days | 300 | 30 |
| PRO | ₹7,999 | 30 days | 1,500 | 150 |
| ENTERPRISE | Custom | 30 days | Unlimited | Unlimited |

### 12.2 Subscription Lifecycle

```
Tenant created (no subscription)
   ↓
Super Admin assigns plan → TenantSubscription (ACTIVE, paymentStatus=PENDING)
   ↓
Payment received offline
   ↓
Super Admin records payment → paymentStatus updated to PAID
   ↓
Subscription expires on endDate (manual renewal in v1)
```

### 12.3 Feature Gating

Features are gated per plan via `SubscriptionGuardService.requireFeature(PlanFeature)`.

If a tenant has **no active subscription**, all features are allowed (fail-open, backward compatible).

If a plan does **not include** a feature, the service throws an error:
```
403: "Your current plan 'BASIC' does not include the 'BULK_UPLOAD' feature. Please upgrade."
```

### 12.4 Available Features (PlanFeature enum)

`STUDENT_MANAGEMENT`, `TEACHER_MANAGEMENT`, `ACADEMIC_MANAGEMENT`, `ATTENDANCE_TRACKING`,
`FEE_MANAGEMENT`, `EXAM_MANAGEMENT`, `HOMEWORK_MANAGEMENT`, `TIMETABLE_MANAGEMENT`,
`PARENT_PORTAL`, `BULK_UPLOAD`, `DASHBOARD_ACCESS`, `ADVANCED_REPORTS`, `CUSTOM_BRANDING`

## Architecture Decisions (Recorded)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Multi-tenancy | Schema-per-tenant | Complete data isolation; no discriminator columns; straightforward backup per school |
| Authentication | Stateless JWT (HS256) | Scalable; no server-side session; standard for REST APIs |
| ORM | Spring Data JPA + Hibernate | Mature, well-supported; custom multi-tenancy hooks available |
| Migration | Flyway | Declarative SQL migrations; easy rollback tracking |
| API Contract | `ApiResponse<T>` envelope | Consistent client-side handling; standard error format |
| DTO pattern | Java records | Immutable, concise; auto-generates `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString` |
| Frontend state | TanStack Query | Server state separate from UI state; automatic caching and invalidation |
| Frontend routing | React Router v7 | File-based routing patterns; nested routes for layouts |

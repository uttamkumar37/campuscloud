**Module:** Backend Security

**What needs to be done:**
- [ ] Add ownership check in `FeesServiceImpl`: if caller role is STUDENT, verify `studentId` matches JWT subject

## Task 41 — Payment Gateway Integration

**Priority:** Medium | **Depends on:** subscription backend (V3 migration)

### Goal
Integrate Razorpay (or Stripe) so tenants can pay online and subscriptions activate automatically on webhook receipt.

### Backend Steps
1. Add `gateway_order_id` to `tenant_subscriptions` via Flyway V4 migration.
2. Create `PaymentGatewayService` interface with `createOrder()` and `verifyWebhook()`.
3. Implement `RazorpayPaymentGatewayServiceImpl`.
4. New endpoints:
   - `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/subscribe/initiate` → returns Razorpay `orderId`
   - `POST /api/v1/payments/webhook` → verifies signature, activates subscription + marks PAID
5. Store API keys via env vars: `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`.

### Frontend Steps
1. In `TenantSubscriptionPage.tsx`, add "Pay Online" button using Razorpay checkout.js.
2. On success, poll `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/subscription` to confirm activation.
